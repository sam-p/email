In this two column responsive email I have hacked the heck out of some templates created by <a href="https://github.com/mailchimp/email-blueprints/tree/master/responsive-templates" target="_blank">MailChimp</a> and used some teachings from their <a href="http://templates.mailchimp.com/development/media-queries/responsive-multi-column-layouts/" target="_blank">blog about multi-column layouts</a>.

Basically, I owe MailChimp a case of beer cause this would have taken a bunch more time to create.
